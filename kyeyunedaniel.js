// This allows you declare a variable that cannot be redeclared and assigns it a value of "are the reason" and the variable is called you

var ans = 'this is not right';
// This allows you declare a variable that can be redeclared and assigns it a value of 'this is not right' and the variable is called ans.
// This is a syntax error because a variable cannot be declared twice. since ans has already been declared using the const let. 
var let ='do you know what you are doing?';
//this allows you declare a variable that can be redeclared and assigns it a value of 'do you know what you are doing?' and the variable is called let.
// Since let is a keyword/reserve name, we should avoid using reserve words as variable names. This is supposed to result to a syntax error but when i run it, the code was working

// This allows you declare a variable that is a constant and assigns it a value of num1>num2? num3:us and the variable is called myNum.
// This is a ternary operator. It checks if num1 is greater than num2. If it is, it assigns num3 to myNum. If it is not, it assigns us to myNum.

//this allows you to check if num3 is not equal to num2 and num2 is equal to num2 and assign the value to num3 !=num2 && num2==num2.
